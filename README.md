## Project Summary

The app lets patients sign in, view doctors' schedules, and book, update, or cancel appointments. Doctors can manage their
availability, and the system notifies them of any appointment changes for efficient communication.

## Features:

* **Sign In:** Users can securely log in to access their accounts.
* **Sign Up:** New users (patients) can register to create an account.
* **Doctor Schedule Management:** Doctors can set their availability by inserting time slots for appointments.
* **Appointment Booking:** Patients can select a doctor, view available slots, and book an appointment.
* **Update Appointment:** Patients can modify their appointment by changing the doctor or the time slot.
* **Cancel Appointment:** Patients have the option to cancel their appointment if needed.
* **View Reservations:** Patients can view a list of all their booked appointments.

## Additional Implementation:

* **Dockerization:** The system is fully dockerized, with three separate containers for the frontend, backend, and database layers, ensuring ease of deployment and scalability.
